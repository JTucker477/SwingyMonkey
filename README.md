# SwingyMonkey


Reinforcement machine learning algorithm that learns how to play “Swinging Monkey”, a game on Pygame. Written in Python using numpy. The algorithm uses Q-learning with an ε-greedy policy. The agent starts out with scores less than 10, but after 100 epochs, my agent could get to a score of 1395. Originially, I just took as input the relative position of the monkey to the next obstacle and the amount of gravity (which varied every trial).

To set up:

install pygame module: http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted and download “SwingyMonkey”
